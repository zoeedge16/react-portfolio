            <p> 
                I am an alumni of the University of Tennessee Knoxville. 
                I have a major in Chemistry and a minor in Italian. 
                I am currently attending Vanderbilt's Software Enginnering Bootcamp.
                I work at Pace National as a Scientist.
                My undergraduate research was with the computational chemistry department headed by Dr. Kostas Vogiatzis. 
                The goal of the reasearch was to create a program that allowed scientists to visualize pharmacrophore moelcules in 3D space.
